## Exercise Guide

**Getting set up**

- You'll need a (free) account at [repl.it](https://repl.it/) to be able to work on the exercises.
- Register using your `repl.it` account at the [Autograder repl](https://seeder-autograder.datadesigns.repl.co)
- Fork the exercise repl; you'll be assigning your answers to variables in the `main.py` file

[--> Pop Quiz repl](https://repl.it/@datadesigns/seeder-pop-quiz)

**Assigning your answers** 

 - Write code in `main.py` such that your answers are assigned to the given variables when `main.py` is run
 - Only what is assigned to the variable names given in the questions will be processed 

**Submitting your answers**

- Run your repl; a web page should be visible in the output pane or at `<repl-name>.<your-replit-user-id>.repl.co`
- Authorize via `repl.it` on the page if necessary then submit your answers using the button to get feedback from the Autograder

**Under the hood...**

1. `main.py` will be executed in your repl when the submission is made
2. some local processing may occur to extract features from the answers
3. the answers, extracted features, and `main.py` will be sent to the Autograder
4. the Autograder will evaluate the posted data and return feedback
5. this feedback will be displayed on the web page served by your repl
